# TableDataGateway_Pattern
This project implements a Client and Employee Management System that connects to a MySQL database. The system allows for retrieving and updating information about customers and employees through a well-structured design using the Table Data Gateway design pattern. The gateway encapsulates database queries, making the codebase modular, easier to maintain, and scalable for future updates.
